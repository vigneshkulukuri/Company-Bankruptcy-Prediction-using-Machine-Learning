# Company-Bankruptcy-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predictive analysis of company bankruptcy using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify whether a company is likely to go bankrupt based on its financial ratios and performance indicators.


# 📊 Company Bankruptcy Prediction using Machine Learning

## 🎯 Objectives

* To predict company bankruptcy using classification algorithms
* To analyze financial risk patterns using clustering techniques
* To compare supervised and unsupervised learning approaches
* To support predictions with meaningful visualizations

## 📂 Dataset Description

* The dataset contains **financial ratios** related to profitability, liquidity, leverage, efficiency, and cash flow.
* Each record represents a company.
* The dataset is collected from **company financial statements and historical records**.

### 🔹 Target Variable

* **`Bankrupt?`**

  * `1` → Bankrupt company
  * `0` → Non-bankrupt company

### 🔹 Feature Variables

* Profitability ratios (ROA, Gross Margin, Net Income ratios)
* Liquidity ratios (Cash Flow, Current Ratio, Quick Ratio)
* Leverage ratios (Debt Ratio, Liability to Equity)
* Efficiency and turnover ratios

## 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used

### ✅ Supervised Learning (Prediction)

* **Logistic Regression**
* **Decision Tree Classifier**
* **Random Forest Classifier**

These models are used to predict whether a company will go bankrupt.
